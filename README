  Getting Started
    To get started with Ants, you'll need to get familiar with Git.

    To initialize your local repository using the Ants trees, use a command like this:
          $git clone https://github.com/ionutteaca/ants.git
    Then:
          $ cd ants/
          $ ls           #you have to see "lin  README"
          $ cd lin/starter_bots/java/
          $ make
          $ cd ../../    # go back in ants/lin/
          $ ./playgame.py --log_dir game_logs -So --verbose --engine_seed 42 --player_seed 0 --turns 100 --map_file maps/cell_maze/cell_maze_p02_19.map "./bot32" "java -cp starter_bots/java MyBot" | java -jar visualizer.jar

    If the last command lunched the visualizer.jar, you have succeeded to run
    the project. Congratulations!!!
